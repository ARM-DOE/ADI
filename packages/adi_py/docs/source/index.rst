Welcome to ADI Python
#####################
This site provides documentation for implementing ARM processes via Python.
Specifically it describes the new Python ADI bindings which are fully integrated
with `XArray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ to provide a more Pythonic
programming experience.

Please follow the steps in :ref:`getting-started` to get started developing
a project with the new Python API.

.. admonition:: Note

    The new ADI Python bindings are currently only deployed on dev servers
    for beta testing.  In addition, the API and examples currently only support
    VAPs.  Ingest support is coming soon.
